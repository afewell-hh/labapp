# Hedgehog Lab Appliance

Virtual appliance for Hedgehog Fabric learning and lab exercises.

## Project Status

🚧 **In Development** 

## Overview

The goal of this project is to provide a virtual appliance that loads into a state that is aligned with the [Hedgehog Fabric learning labs](hedgehog.cloud/learn). The virtual appliance will load into a state that allows users to immediately begin working through the labs without needing to perform initial setup steps.

## 

Initially I plan to manually build a gcp virtual machine image that has all the necessary software installed and configured. Future iterations may include automated build pipelines to create and publish updated appliance images.
