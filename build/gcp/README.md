# GCP build access and VM lease primitives

- `bootstrap-access.sh`: owner-run keyless access setup (see
  [`docs/runbooks/gcp-build-access.md`](../../docs/runbooks/gcp-build-access.md)).
- `lifecycle/`: offline-testable single-slot VM lease primitives for #153.
  **Library and tests only.** Includes an opt-in GCS store adapter; no workflow
  invokes it. It grants no IAM and launches no VM.

## Lifecycle module contract

Python 3.12 standard library only. The controller/spec and offline tests need
no network or credentials. State and cloud access are injected; real adapters
perform network access only when explicitly called.

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `spec.py` | Fixed inspection spec: `e2-standard-2`, `us-central1-a`, 10 GB boot + 300 GB copy of the selected source image (both `pd-standard`, both `autoDelete: true`, the copy attached `READ_ONLY`), no external IP, no service account, absolute `scheduling.terminationTime` with `DELETE` (60 minutes by default). Builds, validates and hashes the exact `instances.insert` body |
| `store.py` | `SlotStore` protocol: generation-matched writes (`if_generation_match`, 0 = must not exist), **no delete**. `MemoryStore` models Cloud Storage generation semantics |
| `cloud.py` | `PolicyCloud`: the only call surface. Allows only `instances.{insert,get,list,delete}`, `disks.{get,list,delete}`, `zoneOperations.{get,list}` in the fixed project/zone, plus read-only `{instances,disks,globalOperations}.aggregatedList` for the census. The constructor rejects any project/zone other than the approved constants. Images, snapshots, addresses, stop/start/setScheduling/setMetadata, IAM and quota calls are rejected before reaching any transport |
| `controller.py` | State machine `FREE → RESERVED → ACTIVE → FREE`, plus `CLEANUP_FAILED`, on **one persistent slot object** |
| `fakes.py`, `test_lifecycle.py` | Fake cloud with failure injection and the invariant tests |

### Safety contract

- `Config.lease_minutes` defaults to 60 and may shorten the lease to an
  integer from 1 to 60. `min_submit_minutes` must be shorter than that lease;
  a fixed five-minute pilot uses a one-minute submission margin. Admission
  rechecks these bounds before writing intent; an existing deadline is never
  extended.
- **Every** transition (admit, submit, ID capture, failure, release) is a
  compare-and-swap on the slot generation, for the creator, normal cleanup
  and the janitor alike. The slot object is never deleted, so a released slot
  is reusable; a stale actor loses its write instead of overwriting a newer
  lease.
- `admit` persists the UUID (`requestId`), the exact body hash, the intended
  names and the immutable deadline **before** any cloud call. Identity fields
  and the deadline cannot change while a lease is held.
- `submit` records the attempt before sending, reuses the persisted UUID and
  body, and never mints a new UUID. Default is one attempt
  (`max_submit_attempts`); retry semantics for `requestId` are not verified.
- Admission fails closed over the **whole project** (every zone, all pages of
  `aggregatedList`; a failed page, unreachable scope or runaway paging blocks):
  any instance or disk not in the lead-supplied `baseline` (name → immutable
  id), or any non-DONE operation, blocks the lease. Baseline VMs are protected
  but still count: total VMs (running or stopped, any zone) plus the new lease
  must not exceed `max_vm_slots` (3), so four baseline VMs never admit a fifth.
  Prefix lookalikes are unknown, not owned. This is a serial one-slot gate, not
  a multi-slot allocator.
- `reconcile` is the only path to `FREE`. Before any delete it runs an
  all-or-nothing preflight: every existing resource must match name, lease
  label, zone and immutable id, and an existing VM must have **exactly** the
  two intended disks attached (boot read-write, source copy `READ_ONLY`). Any
  unexpected or mismatched child blocks the VM delete too, because VM delete
  also removes `autoDelete` disks. An id not yet recorded is adopted only with
  proof (a completed insert whose `clientOperationId` is this lease's UUID, and
  a creation time not before the reservation); labels alone never suffice. Then
  it deletes the VM, then each disk, by exact name, waits for the delete
  operation, and requires a 404 for **all three** before release.
  - An error, identity mismatch, still-existing resource or foreign pending
    operation keeps the slot occupied (`CLEANUP_FAILED` or `blocked`).
  - A 404, timeout or HTTP error on create is not proof the create failed. A
    lease with submit attempts but no insert operation for **its own request
    id** and no VM is held (an operation that only targets the same name does
    not count) is held. Elapsed time and the deadline never release it: past
    the deadline it reports `blocked` until a terminal current-request insert
    operation is seen and VM and both disks are verified absent. If the
    operation has aged out of the list, the slot stays blocked for manual
    review (conservative; whether Compute rejects a late create after
    `terminationTime` is an unverified assumption, not relied on).
  - `reconcile(request_id)` is the owner's forced cleanup and leaves a newer
    lease alone (`superseded`). `reconcile()` is the janitor: it acts only on
    expired, stopped or previously failed leases.

### Run the tests

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s build/gcp/lifecycle -t build/gcp -v
```

## GCS slot adapter

`lifecycle/gcs.py` implements `SlotStore`; construct
`GcsSlotStore(bucket, token_provider=...)` with an existing private ledger
bucket. Only `slots/slot-1.json` is allowed by default. The shared
`auth_http.py` transport gets short-lived credentials from the trusted runner's
existing `gcloud` identity; it never logs tokens, follows redirects or retries
writes. Tests inject fake HTTP and credentials and make no cloud calls.

Reads fetch metadata then the body pinned to that generation. A revision lost
between requests triggers a bounded fresh read; it never becomes absence in
that call. Writes use `ifGenerationMatch`; HTTP 412 raises `PreconditionFailed`.
Other HTTP, malformed-data or network failures raise `StoreError`, blocking
progress. After an uncertain write, re-read and re-evaluate the controller
state; do not blindly repeat a transition. The adapter cannot delete objects
or manage buckets/IAM. See its module docstring for official API references.

The lifecycle discovery command above includes the HTTP-contract tests.
Mocked tests establish request/response handling, not live bucket/IAM behavior.

## Not covered yet (gates before any VM)

- The GCS adapter has mocked HTTP tests only; no Compute adapter is included
  yet. None of the live API behavior is exercised: `requestId` retention/idempotence, `terminationTime` plus
  `DELETE` removing `autoDelete` disks, whether disk labels from
  `initializeParams` propagate, whether an inline source-image disk is
  accepted with `READ_ONLY` mode (no writable fallback exists; if the API
  rejects it the design must change, not the check), the shape of
  `aggregatedList` warnings, org-policy effects, quota behavior and operation listing latency.
  The fake is a model, not evidence.
- No workflow, guest extraction stage, or private output channel.
- No IAM: custom roles, scoped create versus delete permissions, the ledger
  bucket and separate trusted identities need separate review.
- The boot image must be a pinned stock Ubuntu 24.04 image id (supplied by the
  lead, not a family), with required guest tools verified in it because the
  VM has no internet access.
- Three-slot allocation is intentionally absent; the counter would need its
  own race tests first.
