# This directory is where students create their active configurations
#
# The .gitkeep file ensures this directory exists in Git even when empty
#
# To get started:
# 1. Copy an example from ../examples/
# 2. Modify it for your use case
# 3. Commit and push to trigger ArgoCD sync
#
# Example:
#   cp ../examples/vpc-simple.yaml my-first-vpc.yaml
#   git add my-first-vpc.yaml
#   git commit -m "Create my first VPC"
#   git push origin main
